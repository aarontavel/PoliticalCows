	<h1>Cow Population and State Political Affiliation</h1>
    
    <h2> Introduction: </h2>
    <p>For the final project, we explore the (possibly) fascinating relationship between cow population and national political affiliation of different states. By analyzing data from Agricultural Census Reports and state political affiliation records, we aim to uncover any potential patterns between these variables.</p>
        
    <h2> Data Collection: </h2>
        
    <p> To conduct our research, we gathered data from various reliable sources. The primary source of information for cow population statistics is the Agricultural Census Data, which provides data on livestock across the United States. Additionally, we obtained data on state political affiliations by analyzing the voting patterns of the 2010 congressional election. These political affiliation records were sourced from reputable political news websites and federal election databases.
    Our formal research question is as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Is there a correlation between where cows are found and the national political affiliation of a state?</strong></p>
    
    <h3> Visualizations: </h3>

	<p>*Clicking on each bubble introduces a chart that displays the growth rate of the cow population from 2010 to 2023 for each state </p>

    <p> The above visualization has three components: the bubble chart, the tooltip, and the bar chart. The primary component is the bubble chart that visually represents the cow growth (size of bubbles), along with the democratic/republican lean (color of bubbles) taken from the 2010 congressional election. When you hover over each bubble, a tooltip appears that displays the democrat/republican breakdown. </p>

    <p> The above visualization has two components: the cow map and the tooltip. This map was created in ArcGis Pro and ArcGis Online.  In our map the color of the tiles represents democratic/republican lean as blue/red respectively for the 2010 midterm election. This takes into account all statewide election results from any House elections for the appropriate state.  The size of the cow in each state represents the total number of cows in that state in 2010. The tooltip, which can be accessed by selecting any state, contains the number of cows, vote percentage for each political affiliation, and the difference between the Republican and Democratic vote symbolized as Republican vote minus Democratic vote for that state. </p>
    
<p>   By observing these visualizations, one would notice:
</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li> The growth rate of cow population is highest among Republican leaning states </li>
        <li> 9 out of 10 of the states with the largest cow populations in 2010 were Republican leaning </li> 
    </ol>

    
	<p>Note: This website is purely for informational purposes and does not aim to make definitive claims or draw conclusive evidence about causality between cow populations and political affiliation. The data presented should be interpreted with caution, considering the multitude of factors that can influence these variables.  One of these factors, for example, is the election of Barack Obama in 2008. The Presidential Election and subsequent passage of the Affordable Care Act caused a large anti-Democratic movement to sweep the nation in 2010 resung in a Republican wave of voters.  The 2010 election resulted in the most House seats being flipped in a midterm election since 1938.  As a consequence of this, the 2010 election should not be considered representative of the broader American electorate's political opinion.
